# Backend Development Stack

## Overview

The backend will provide APIs for the frontend and mobile app to interact with the database. It will be developed using modern technologies to ensure scalability and performance.

## Technologies

1. **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js and provides an out-of-the-box application architecture.
2. **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing data. It is designed for robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries.
3. **TypeORM**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for TypeScript and JavaScript. It provides a schema-based solution to model data and interact with PostgreSQL.
4. **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
5. **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments. It allows applications to be packaged with all their dependencies.
